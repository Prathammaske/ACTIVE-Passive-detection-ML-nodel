# ACTIVE-Passive-detection-ML-nodel
Project Description: Active-Passive Detection Using Machine Learning
Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project designed to detect active versus passive states in various contexts, such as user engagement, device activity, or system states. The project involves data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model development, and performance evaluation to accurately classify states as active or passive.

Objectives
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather and preprocess a dataset containing features indicative of active and passive states.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to understand the distribution, relationships, and patterns within the dataset.
Feature Engineering: Extract and create meaningful features to enhance the predictive power of the model.
Model Development: Develop, train, and evaluate various machine learning models to classify states as active or passive.
Performance Evaluation: Assess the models' performance using appropriate metrics and select the best-performing model for deployment.
